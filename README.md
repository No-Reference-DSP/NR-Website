# NR-Website

This repo will hold the front-end, back-end, and whatever else is necessary to build a website for "No Reference DSP" and "No Reference". Both these fictitious names are associated with my DSP work and my artist work, respectively. 

## Purpose
The reason I'm making this website is to showcase my work, as sort of a portfolio, for both my products and my art.


# Getting things started
1. Download/install the latest version of Nodejs
2. Go to client folder run: npm install 
3. Run: npm install -D tailwindcss
4. For the backend `cd server` run: npm install express --save
5. npm install --save-dev nodemon
6. Run Front-end with: npm run dev
7. Run Back-end with:  npm run dev

(I think the backend dependencies got pushed to the repo, so you might just be able to hit step 5 and step 7)
