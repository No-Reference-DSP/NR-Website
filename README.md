# NR-Website

This repo will hold the front-end, back-end, and whatever else is necessary to build a website for "No Reference DSP" and "No Reference". Both these fictitious names are associated with my DSP work and my artist work, respectively. 

## Purpose
The reason I'm making this website is to showcase my work, as sort of a portfolio, for both my products and my art.
