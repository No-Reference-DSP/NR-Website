# NR-Website

This repo will hold the front-end, back-end, and whatever else is necessary to build a website for "No Reference DSP" and "No Reference". Both these fictitious names are associated with my DSP work and my artist work, respectively. 

## Purpose
The reason I'm making this website is to showcase my work, as sort of a portfolio, for both my products and my art.

## Tech being used
- React
- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- TypeScript
- React-Howler
- Express.js (might remove if Next.js suffices) 


# Getting things started
1. Download/install the latest version of Nodejs
2. Go to client folder run: `npm install` 
3. `cd client` then Run: `npm install -D tailwindcss`
4. For the backend `cd server` run: `npm install express --save`
5. In the backkend run: `npm install --save-dev nodemon`
6. Inside /client Run the Front-end with: `npm run dev`
7. Inside /server Run Back-end with:  `npm run dev`

inside of /client
8. run `npm install howler` for the audio player library howler.js
9. run `npm instasll --save react-howler` for the react wrapper of howler.js
10. run `npm install react-icons --save`

11. run `npm install --save @types/react-howler` ?? This is a maybe
12. run `npm install --save @types/howler`
12. run `npm install react-icons --save` for react icons

(I think the backend dependencies got pushed to the repo, so you might just be able to hit step 5 and step 7)
